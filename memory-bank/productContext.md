# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Users often have to switch between different apps to track their daily expenses and their long-term investments. This fragmentation makes it hard to get a holistic view of their financial health ("What do I have? Where is it going?").

## Solution
"Cebim" (My Pocket) is a unified application that brings personal finance and investment tracking together. It offers a simple interface for daily transactions while providing powerful insights into investment performance, all stored locally for privacy.

## User Experience Goals
- **Speed**: Quick transaction entry is crucial for daily habit building.
- **Clarity**: The dashboard should answer "How much money do I have?" and "Am I on budget?" instantly.
- **Privacy**: Users should feel safe knowing their financial data stays on their device.
- **Aesthetics**: Modern, Dark Mode design with specific color coding (Slate-950 background, Indigo-500 accents).
- **Accessibility**: High readability with Inter font and clear contrast.
