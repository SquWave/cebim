# System Patterns

## Architecture
- **Client-Side Only**: Single Page Application (SPA) running entirely in the browser.
- **Local Persistence**: Data is stored in `localStorage`.
- **Component-Based**: Built with React components.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **PWA**: Designed as a Progressive Web App for installability on mobile devices.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Manual Updates (MVP)**: Investment prices are updated manually by the user in the MVP phase.
- **Dark Mode Default**: The application is designed with a dark theme as the default.
